        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her",

In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\".

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours",

Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances.

But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended",

The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat.

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (\u00c2\u00a34.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe. Samsung Electronics has said it has goods worth about $38m on Hanjin ships in international waters. It is now considering chartering 16 freighter planes to take goods to customers - mostly in the US.

        "The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No damage was recorded, but the incident raised concerns about airspace safety. Drones, while popular for aerial photography and recreation, can pose significant risks when flown near airplanes.

However, with the increasing availability of drones, these regulations can be difficult to enforce. The incident has prompted calls for stricter enforcement of existing rules and possibly new regulations to address the growing number of drones in the skies. Aviation safety experts emphasize the importance of education for drone operators to ensure they understand the potential dangers their devices pose to manned aircraft. The CAA continues to investigate the incident and collaborate with other agencies to enhance airspace safety.",
        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to be with their newborns. The reasons cited for not taking leave ranged from financial constraints to concerns about job security and workplace culture. This highlights a significant issue in how paternity leave is perceived and utilized in the workplace. Despite studies showing the benefits of paternity leave for families and businesses alike, many companies still do not offer adequate support or encouragement for new fathers to take time off. This can lead to increased stress and decreased productivity for employees, as well as missed opportunities for bonding and caregiving in the crucial early weeks of a child's life. It is important for businesses to recognize the value of paternity leave and create a more supportive environment for new fathers. By doing so, they can foster a more inclusive and family-friendly workplace culture, which can ultimately lead to greater employee satisfaction and retention.",

        "Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin shipping vessels, fearing they won't be compensated for their services, which has caused a significant disruption to global trade. The collapse of Hanjin, the world's seventh-largest container carrier, has left billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea, affecting retailers and manufacturers worldwide. The uncertainty surrounding the handling and delivery of these goods has sent shockwaves through supply chains, prompting concerns about potential shortages and price increases. \n\nIn response to the crisis, some ports have started to allow Hanjin ships to dock, but only with guarantees of payment. However, the resolution of this situation remains uncertain, as the company continues to seek financial support to resolve its debts and unload its cargo. The South Korean government has been working to mitigate the impact on the country's export-driven economy, but the future of Hanjin and the broader implications for the shipping industry remain unclear. This situation highlights the vulnerabilities in global trade and the need for more robust safeguards to protect against such disruptions.",

        "The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be given more support and clearer information about the risks of long-term credit card debt. The FCA's recent report highlighted that nearly six million people are struggling with persistent credit card debt, paying more in interest and charges than they have repaid of their borrowing over an 18-month period. The regulator has proposed a series of measures to tackle this issue, including requiring firms to take steps to help customers repay their debt more quickly. These measures could include reducing interest rates, waiving fees, or offering repayment plans that are tailored to the customer's financial situation. The FCA also suggested that firms should be more proactive in identifying customers at risk of financial difficulties and offering them support before they fall into persistent debt. The goal is to create a fairer and more transparent credit card market that works better for consumers, helping them to manage their finances more effectively and avoid the pitfalls of long-term debt.",

        "The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate has been reduced by 25 basis points to 4.35%. This move by the central bank is aimed at boosting economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. The decision was influenced by recent data showing a slowdown in economic activity, including a decline in industrial production and exports. Analysts believe that the rate cut could help stimulate investment and spending, which have been sluggish in recent months. However, some experts warn that the impact may be limited if other structural issues, such as high levels of corporate debt and overcapacity in some industries, are not addressed. The central bank has also reduced the reserve requirement ratio for banks, which could further increase liquidity in the financial system. Overall, the rate cut is seen as a positive step towards supporting economic recovery, but its effectiveness will depend on a range of other factors.",

Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a modern retirement complex, sparking controversy among local residents and historians. The proposed development includes demolishing the existing structure to make way for 74 luxurious apartments tailored to the elderly, complete with communal facilities such as a wellness center and a restaurant. PegasusLife argues that the new development will revitalize the area, providing high-quality housing options for seniors and boosting the local economy. However, opponents of the project contend that it would erase an important piece of local history and alter the character of the community. They are urging the developer to consider preserving the original building and incorporating it into the new design. The debate continues as the planning application progresses, with both sides eager to see their vision for the site come to fruition."
