        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The",

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties.

The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase.

The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We",

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service.

In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.

The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than",

Defender Debuchy, who just returned from three months out with an ankle injury, had an operation on a shoulder he dislocated in the win over Stoke. Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as \"unbelievable\". \"It's very unfortunate,\" said the Frenchman. \"It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again.\" Debuchy has played just 14 times since signing from Newcastle in July in a deal worth a reported \u00a312m. With Kieran Gibbs recovering from an inflamed heel, 19-year-old Hector Bellerin or Calum Chambers may deputise against Manchester City on Sunday.

        "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus",

The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a \"professional\" way, some officers still displayed \"negative and uninformed\" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: \"A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.\" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would \"slip through the net\". In response, the College of Policing is setting up a pilot scheme to help",

        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to take a leading role in addressing the global climate crisis by providing sustainable financing solutions. The former Governor of the Bank of England emphasized that the transition to a low-carbon economy requires significant investment, particularly in developing countries.\n\nCarney warned that the lack of access to long-term financing hinders the ability of emerging markets to implement green projects, thereby exacerbating climate-related risks. He advocated for the creation of a \"Green Investment Platform\" to channel funding into sustainable infrastructure projects in these regions.\n\nThe renowned economist emphasized that Germany, with its strong financial sector and commitment to environmental protection, is well-positioned to drive this initiative. By promoting green financing, Germany can help mitigate the risks associated with climate change while fostering economic growth and stability. Carney's remarks underscore the critical role that financial institutions must play in addressing the climate crisis, and the importance of international cooperation",

Ride-hailing giant Uber announced a major expansion of its bike rental service, promising to bring affordable and convenient transportation to more cities worldwide. The move is seen as a direct challenge to traditional bike-sharing companies and car ownership as we know it. With the rise of subscription-based services and the growing popularity of car-sharing apps, it's becoming increasingly clear that the way we think about transportation is undergoing a radical shift. The benefits are twofold: reduced congestion on our roads and a significant decrease in air pollution. As cities around the world grapple with the challenges of urbanization, it's likely that this new model of transportation will become the norm. One thing is certain - the future of getting from A to B is about to get a whole lot more interesting.",

The scheme, which is being rolled out across the country, allows patients to visit pharmacies without an appointment to receive advice and treatment for common conditions such as sore throats and earaches.\n\nNHS England claims that the move will not only reduce the pressure on GP surgeries but also help to combat antibiotic resistance. Over-prescription of antibiotics has been linked to the rise of superbugs, and by treating minor illnesses in pharmacies, the need for antibiotics can be reduced. The service is also expected to improve access to healthcare for vulnerable patients, such as the elderly and those living in rural areas, who may struggle to get to a GP surgery. The move is part of a wider effort to transform the way healthcare is delivered in England and to make better use of pharmacists",
        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been erupting on and off since 1955, has seen a significant increase in activity in recent years, with more frequent and intense eruptions. According to a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports, the volcano's magma chamber is filling up at an alarming rate, with the potential to unleash a devastating eruption. The researchers used advanced computer simulations to model the volcano's behavior and found that the magma chamber is currently 10 times larger than previously thought. This increased size, combined with the volcano's history of violent eruptions, makes Sakurajima a significant threat to the surrounding region, which is home to over 1 million people. The researchers warn that authorities need to take immediate action to prepare for a potential disaster, including evacuating nearby residents and implementing emergency response plans.",

        "The number given for the current account customers hit by the fraud is fewer than half of the 20,000 initially reported to have been affected. Personal data of thousands of customers was compromised in a massive data breach that rocked the financial industry last month. The bank has now confirmed that approximately 8,000 customers have been affected, a significant decrease from the initial estimate.\n\nThe breach, which occurred when a third-party contractor's laptop was stolen, exposed sensitive information such as names, addresses, and account numbers. The bank has assured customers that no financial information, including passwords and PIN numbers, was compromised.\n\nAn investigation is underway to determine the extent of the breach and to identify those responsible. The bank has promised to provide free credit monitoring services to affected customers and has urged them to remain vigilant and monitor their accounts closely. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in the financial sector.",
        "The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. The allegations led to Hutsby's arrest and subsequent conviction for harassment, for which he received a 12-month community order. However, in a shocking turn of events, it has emerged that Hutsby went on to exact a deadly revenge on his accuser.\n\nIn October 2014, just months after his conviction, Hutsby brutally murdered the woman in her own home. The senseless attack sent shockwaves through the community, leaving friends and family reeling in grief. An investigation into the murder revealed a trail of warning signs that had been ignored, sparking widespread outrage and calls for reform.\n\nThe case has raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the justice system in protecting victims of domestic abuse. Critics argue that Hutsby's history of threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions should have triggered a more robust response from authorities. As the",

        "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a safety knowledge exam for all private hire drivers, including those working for ride-hailing apps like Uber. The proposed changes aim to improve safety and standards in the capital's private hire industry.\n\nThe new requirements would apply to all private hire drivers, including those currently licensed, and would need to be completed every three years. The English language test would assess a driver's ability to communicate effectively with passengers, while the map-reading assessment would evaluate their knowledge of London's streets. The safety knowledge exam would cover topics such as customer safety, disability awareness, and preventing sexual exploitation.\n\nTfL claims that the new requirements would help to improve passenger safety and reduce the risk of incidents. The consultation period is expected to run for six weeks, with the changes potentially coming into effect later this year. The move has been welcomed by passenger safety campaigners, who have long called",
        "The Saddlers looked more likely to take the lead in the first half, with Albion goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin keeping out Paul Downing and Romaine Sawyers with impressive saves. Walsall's high-intensity press and swift counter-attacks had the Baggies on the back foot, and they could have easily taken the lead if not for McLaughlin's heroics.\n\nIn the 25th minute, Downing's powerful header was denied by McLaughlin's outstretched hand, while Sawyers' long-range effort was palmed away by the Albion goalkeeper just before halftime. Walsall's dominance was a testament to their well-drilled midfield, which stifled Albion's creative attempts and limited their clear-cut chances.\n\nDespite their best efforts, Walsall couldn't find the breakthrough, and the score remained goalless at the break. The second half saw a more spirited Albion response, but Walsall's resolute defense held firm to secure a hard",

        "Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales have been criticized for their approach to domestic abuse cases, with inspectors finding that officers were prioritizing cases involving physical violence over those with psychological manipulation or coercive control. The report highlighted that this narrow focus was leading to missed opportunities to identify and support victims at high risk of harm.\n\nInspectors found that officers were often relying on victims to disclose information, rather than actively investigating and gathering evidence. This approach was deemed ineffective, as many victims of domestic abuse are reluctant to come forward due to fear, shame, or emotional manipulation. The College of Policing has called for a shift in approach, urging officers to consider a broader range of risk factors, including controlling behavior, isolation, and emotional abuse. By adopting a more comprehensive approach, police forces can better identify and support victims of domestic abuse, ultimately reducing the risk of harm and saving lives.",
        "The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to clear the upper house within the next few weeks. The move marks a significant shift in Japan's defense policy, which has been restricted by its pacifist constitution since the end of World War Two.\n\nThe new laws would enable Japanese troops to engage in combat missions abroad, providing they are part of a United Nations-led operation. Proponents of the changes argue that they are necessary to allow Japan to play a more active role in international peacekeeping efforts. Critics, however, have raised concerns that the move could lead to Japan becoming embroiled in foreign conflicts and compromising its pacifist principles.\n\nThe legislation has sparked heated debate in Japan, with many arguing that it marks a significant departure from the country's post-war commitment to pacifism. Despite these concerns, the government remains committed to pushing through the changes, which it believes are",

A company called Atari made the game in 1982, and it was released for the Atari 2600 console. The game was intended to be a tie-in with the popular movie of the same name, but it ended up being a commercial failure.\n\nAccording to legend, the remaining copies of the game were buried in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in the early 1980s.

        "Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the highly valuable cargo: diamonds. The daring heist, which occurred at Brussels Airport, has left authorities stunned and searching for answers.\n\nThe thieves, who were dressed in police uniforms and arrived at the airport in a car with flashing lights, managed to bypass security and gain access to the plane's cargo hold.

Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a luxury retirement village, sparking outrage among local residents. The hotel, situated in the heart of the New Forest, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. Its smuggling past is said to have inspired Stevenson, who stayed at the hotel in the 1880s, to write his classic novel.\n\nHowever, PegasusLife's proposed development has sparked fierce opposition from locals, who argue that the hotel's historic significance and natural surroundings make it an inappropriate site for a large-scale retirement complex.
