Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race.

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head.

It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it \"difficult to control his anger\" and had \"no insight\" into the impact of his actions on others. Despite this assessment, Butler's daughter Ellie was returned to his care in 2012 after being removed at birth due to concerns about domestic violence. Tragically, 6-year-old Ellie was murdered by her father just 11 months later. The case has raised serious questions about how child protection services assess risk and make decisions about returning children to potentially dangerous environments. An inquest into Ellie's death highlighted failures by social workers to properly investigate allegations of abuse against Butler. The heartbreaking case underscores the critical importance of prioritizing child safety and thoroughly evaluating parents' capacity to provide a stable, nur",

        "These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted by Joop Van Der Linde, a guest at Ndutu Safari Lodge in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The scene unfolded when a leopard cub, estimated to be only a few weeks old, approached the lioness, who had recently given birth to her own cubs.\n\nRemarkably, the lioness accepted the leopard cub and began nursing it alongside her own offspring. Interspecies nursing is incredibly uncommon in the wild, making this a truly exceptional occurrence. Experts believe that the lioness's maternal instincts likely overrode any species-specific differences, allowing her to care for the vulnerable leopard cub.\n\nWhile the ultimate fate of the leopard cub remains unknown, these stunning images capture a rare moment of cross-species nur",

        "The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate has been reduced from 3.85% to 3.6%, while the five-year rate, which is typically used for mortgage loans, has been lowered from 4.65% to 4.45%. The decision by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) aims to stimulate the economy amidst concerns over slowing growth and trade tensions with the United States. The move is expected to boost consumer spending and support the struggling property market. Analysts predict that the rate cut could inject much-needed liquidity into the economy, but some caution that it may not be enough to completely offset the impact of the ongoing trade war. The PBOC's action demonstrates the government's commitment to stabilizing economic growth and maintaining financial stability in the face of domestic and international challenges.",
        "The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called \"bearer bonds\". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to avoid taxes and maintain financial secrecy. The investigation focuses on whether the bank facilitated tax evasion by selling these bonds to American clients.

If found guilty of wrongdoing, the bank could face significant fines and reputational damage. The investigation highlights the ongoing efforts of US regulators to crack down on offshore tax evasion and the role of financial institutions in enabling such practices.

Supporters of the legislation, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, maintain that the changes are necessary to enable Japan to defend itself and its allies in an increasingly volatile region. The bills would allow Japan to engage in collective self-defense, meaning that its troops could come to the aid of allies under attack, even if Japan itself is not directly threatened.
